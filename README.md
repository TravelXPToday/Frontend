# Frontend

### Tailwind
Why we chose [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com)
- You can use pre-built CSS classes for styling, which saves you the time and effort of writing custom CSS from scratch

### Components

In react we work with components. This is because we want no overlapping code. We can re-use these components to avoid overlapping code.
